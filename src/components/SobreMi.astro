<p class="sobreMi ">Hello everyone! My name is Cristian Milesi, but most of my friends know me as Tata. <br> As a <span class=" text-cruise-600"> web developer </span>, I specialise in building websites from concept to launch. Over the past few years, I've been honing my skills as a freelancer, tackling projects for clients and personal ventures alike. I'm constantly keeping abreast of new technologies to meet the evolving needs of the industry.</p> <br>
<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me making music. I've had the pleasure of collaborating with various groups and released my singer-songwriter album 'Desmudanzas' in 2023. I also spent a decade teaching music in Paran√° and Rosario, Argentina. </p> <br>
<p>My goal is to continue my journey as a web developer, using my diverse skills to create engaging and meaningful digital experiences.</p>
